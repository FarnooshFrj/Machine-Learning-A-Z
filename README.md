##Data preprocessing
This section covers essential data preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Feature scaling (standardization)

---
##Linear Regression
This section includes both **simple linear regression** and **multiple linear regression**:

Simple: y = a + b x
Multiple: y = a + b1 x1 + b2 x2 + ...

Models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

---
##Polynimial Regression  
Polynomial regression extends linear regression by including higher-degree terms:

y = a + b1 x + b2 x^2 + ... + bn x^n

In this section, the model is trained on the entire dataset, and used to predict new outcomes
